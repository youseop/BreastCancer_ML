# BreastCancer_ML
practice Machine Learning with Wisconsin Breast Cancer data(Kaggle)

i use KNN, ANN and SVM model to predict whether the cancer is B or M.


I did this project in colab. 
So, if you wanna use this file, you should mount your drive to colab.

Add the code below to your ipynb file.


from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


Also the location of my file is 

/content/drive/My Drive/online_shoppers_intention.csv/~


[online_shoppers_intention.csv >>
this is the name of folder where the data and files are in
i made mistake but i didn't change the name of folder]


so please put the files in 

'online_shoppers_intention.csv'

this folder and the location of this folder should be 

'/content/drive/My Drive/online_shoppers_intention.csv/~'

if you don't, there will be many things you should change



Thanks!
